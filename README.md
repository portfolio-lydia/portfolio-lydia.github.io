vanilla JavaScript and React projects

This portfolio contains my vanilla JavaScript projects that are based on the JavaScript 30 challenge by Wes Bros. I had fun making small tweaks to them!
Besides vanilla JavaScript, I also made a React project as part of the 4 months front-end development training I received at Winc Academy.
